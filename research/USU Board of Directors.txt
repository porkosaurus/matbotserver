USU Board of Directors meeting
Follow the University Student Union Board of Directors on Instagram: @csunusu_bod

Over the last few years, the USU Board of Directors (BOD) and its committees have launched popular CSUN student destinations including the Student Recreation Center, Oasis Wellness Center, Pride Center and Veterans Resource Center. The BOD also approved making the DREAM Center a department of the University Student Union in 2020.

As the student leaders of a non-profit auxiliary of the CSUN campus, the Board of Directors is primarily responsible for developing policy for the USU. The overall purposes and responsibilities of the BOD are to maintain USU buildings and facilities, oversee financial matters, facilitate programs and adopt policies in the best interest of students, in keeping with the policies set forth by the Trustees of the California State University system and CSUN.

Start doing more now for your campus through involvement with the University Student Union Board of Directors.

Are you interested in joining the USU BOD? There are three ways to get involved:
Run for a seat on the BOD in the Spring Elections. Each spring, students run in the AS/USU elections for five of the ten student seats.
Apply for an open seat on the BOD if there are any vacancies. Contact the BOD Assistant to find out about any current vacancies.
Join a USU Board of Directors standing committee to learn about the USU and BOD while developing skills for the future. The standing committees include: the audit committee, the facilities and commercial services committee, the finance committee, and the personnel committee. Students who serve on committees and demonstrate leadership potential are always encouraged to run for a seat on the BOD.
Eligibility:
Students who serve on the BOD or a committee must have a minimum cumulative and semester 2.0 GPA, and must have completed at least one semester at California State University, Northridge.
