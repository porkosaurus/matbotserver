Welcome to Graduate Studies
We are delighted that you are considering or have joined us here at CSUN. Our campus offers several graduate programs that give students the opportunity to work one-on-one with faculty while simultaneously benefiting from all the services that a large campus provides. CSUNâ€™s graduate programs focus on real-world issues where our students will learn the tools needed to solve local and global problems. 

The Office of Graduate Studies encompasses Graduate Domestic Admissions, Graduate Evaluation Services and the Graduate Resource and Academic Development (GRAD) Center. We are responsible for the graduate domestic admissions process and implementing university graduate policies and procedures. We also provide scholarship opportunities and resources in addition to facilitating events aimed at fostering students' academic success.  

We hope that you will come and visit us in Valera Hall during your time at CSUN.
