The DREAM Center of the University Student Union at CSUN is a welcoming resource center that provides resources and services to undocumented students, mixed status families, staff, faculty, allies and future undocumented students while fostering a more inclusive campus community. DREAM stands for Dreamers, Resources, Empowerment, Advocacy and Mentorship. You can meet with us by appointment or just walk in to our space at the USU.

We provide resources and services to help empower students so that they can become advocates during their educational trajectory.
We increase knowledge of the ever-changing political climate which affect students in their personal and professional lives.
We believe students thrive and undergo a transformation when they feel supported and empowered in their autonomies to confidently pursue their aspirations and goals.
